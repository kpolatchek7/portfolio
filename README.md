# Project objective

This project will use open source data from IATTC, specifically Shark EPO 
longline catch and effort aggregated by year, month, flag, 5°x5°. This data
will be analyzed to determine catch per unit effort of shark species by diving
total catch by number of hooks set. Additional analysis will aim to determine
the coordinates at which shark catch was highest for each year.
